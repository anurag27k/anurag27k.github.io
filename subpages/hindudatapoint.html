                    In this project we were asked to select a Hindu Data Point (Hindu article with statistical data) and
                    redesign it to make better
                    sense or easy perception of it. It contains vizualizations showing how the prices for petrol have
                    increased
                    in Delhi over the year and how it compares with that in other cities and countries.

                    <i>Figure: Price of petrol in some cities</i>
                    <br><br>
                    In the chart, X-axis plot shows the timeline and the Y-axis plot shows the selling price of petrol.
                    Initially the author tries to compare the prices between the major cities. Probably the author, for
                    this article, has
                    chosen to show only the metropolitan cities. The data is shown from the dates Jun 16 2017 to May 30
                    2021 (approx. 4
                    years).
                    <br><br>
                    Over here we there is a huge dip in the prices between approximately years 2019-20. We also see a
                    sudden rise of the
                    graph from late 2020. The reason behind these two phenomena is unknown. In other areas of the graph
                    we see a steady
                    increase in the prices of petrol.
                    <br><br>
                    Approximating the entire country's data only on the metropolitan cities is a bit absurd. X-axis
                    should contain more
                    values to make more sense of the data. The choice of colors for the graph also seems to be random
                    choice.

                    <br><br>
                    <img src="../img/viz/image 71.png" style="width:50%;">

                    </i>
                    <br><br>

                    The chart depicts the petrol price in Delhi (left axis) against the crude price - Indian basket
                    (right axis) between
                    January 2019 and May 2021.
                    <br><br>
                    Here the author wants to showcase the price of crude oil and the selling price of petrol. The Orange
                    line shows that the
                    prices of crude oil and the red line shows the prices of selling petrol. We see a huge dip in the
                    price of crude oil
                    during april (which was mentioned in the article). Surprisingly the selling petrol price was majorly
                    increasing and saw
                    a small a tiny dip. This majorly hints us at the increases taxes during this period. When the crude
                    oil price was back
                    up in the graph, the taxes continued to rise.
                    <br><br>
                    In the first glance the view is confused seeing the two graphs and two Y-axis. The viewer tends to
                    compare the red graph
                    with the orange graph. These are two graphs merged into one and should not be compared on the same
                    scale. Also there is
                    no index supporting which Y-axis is corresponding to which color. In this graph too the border dates
                    are only shown. We
                    also observe inconsistency in the date range. The first graph shows us data for about 4 years and
                    the second shows for
                    little lesser than 1.5 years. The reason of dip is not mentioned but is mostly due to lockdown.

                    In the next picture we see a table where we see the spiltup of the retail price of petrol. Again we
                    see a different
                    duration is seen over here. One striking point is that we see the taxes increase on a huge margin
                    having centre's tax
                    the biggest contributing factor even though the base price of petrol has reduced.

                    In this graph we see ordinal values as countries on the X-axis. The chosen countries are said that
                    they have comparable
                    economies but the exact metric for comparison is not provided. The Y-axis tells us about the price
                    per litre in Indian
                    Rupees. The values could have been represented in here. Also South Africa, Russia and Brazil are not
                    neighbours.

                    So I tried plotting the splitup of fuel prices in different forms. Below are some of the crude

                    The values for the crude oil prices and MRP of petrol price over the last 2 years was found out and
                    the components and
                    percentages of this was calculated. The other percentage denotes the combination of taxes and other

                    I used a stacked column chart to show how despite of the dip in crude oil price the taxes have kept
                    on increasing. Below

                    For showing the increase in the tax components, I wanted to have a representation which would show
                    the gradual increase.
                    Thus I took 2 stacked column charts and created a smooth transformation using a pen tool. The older
                    one is kept in the
                    right in order to suit the final composition.

                    For the final image the above ones are combined in order to follow to harmony. Data for May 2021 is

                    left chart and is compared to the previous price distribution and in the bottom right it is also
                    compared to the
                    current
                    petrol prices in the neighboring countries.
